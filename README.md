# Clusters in Leaflet
This visualization will help you identify clusters of vendors available. For instance, it shows the number of vendors available in California region vs New York region.
To run this file, download Clusters.R and dummy_data.csv files and place them in the same directory to run it.

Once you run this r script, you should be able to see leaflet map with clusters as shown in Image-1 below. These clusters can be broken down by double clicking on that cluster and/or zoom-in to understand the details. Additionally, once you zoom-in to a city level, then user can interact with that city by clicking on the pin and a popup will show more details about the city such as sate, rank and population.
